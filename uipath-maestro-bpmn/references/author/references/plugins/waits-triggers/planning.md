# Wait and Trigger Planning

Use this reference when planning process starts or pauses that wait for time, messages, schedules, or external events.

## When to use

- Timer starts or timer intermediate events.
- Message or connector-backed starts.
- Intermediate waits for messages or external connector events.
- Timeout branches and boundary timers.

## Planning steps

1. Identify whether the wait begins the process, pauses the current path, or interrupts an activity.
2. Choose timer, message, receive task, event-based gateway, or connector trigger shape.
3. Define correlation inputs and outputs in public-safe terms.
4. Plan timeout and cancellation behavior.
5. Mark Integration Service trigger or wait enrichment as CLI-owned.
6. Confirm whether the process may resume with stale data and how outputs update variables.

## Model may draft

- Standard timer, message, and boundary event structure.
- Receive/wait task wrappers for non-connector message waits.
- `uipath:event` shells for documented non-Integration-Service events.
- Entry point IDs and variable mappings.

## Stop conditions

Stop before Operate when schedule, trigger properties, correlation contract, connector metadata, or dynamic event schema is unresolved.

Do not generate signal, conditional, escalation, compensation, cancel, link,
multiple, or parallel-multiple event definitions for new Maestro BPMN source.
Preserve imported instances only.
