## Investigation Guides

Resolved by triage. Always includes the generic guide (`references/investigation_guide.md`). Includes the product-specific guide if one exists. Other agents read these paths directly — they do NOT scan the references folder themselves.

## Matched Playbooks

Resolved by triage. Full paths to every playbook that matches the symptoms, with confidence level (high/medium/low). High-confidence playbooks have a specific error match and known cause. Medium have concrete diagnostic steps. Low provide general context. The generator uses confidence to decide how many hypotheses to produce per playbook.

## Requirements

Generic key-value store for data gathered during the investigation. Any agent can read it; triage and orchestrator write to it.

- Keys are freeform — use descriptive names (e.g., `folder_id`, `source_code_path`, `queue_name`)
- Values are whatever was collected (string, number, etc.)

## Rules

- Triage sub-agent creates this file and resolves investigation guides, matched playbooks, and requirements
- Other agents read paths from `state.json` — they do NOT browse `references/` themselves (exception: presenter discovers presentation guides directly from domain folders)
- Orchestrator updates `phase` as the investigation progresses
- Any agent can read `requirements`; triage and orchestrator write to it
- The `scope` may be updated by the orchestrator when scope adjustment occurs
